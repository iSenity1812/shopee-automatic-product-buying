- This bot is just an update version of SFSBot since that bot is no longer working due to some errors occured while running with selenium library

*  USAGE:
   * Clone this project
   * Install requirement.txt | python -m pip install requirement.txt
   * Create a 'logs' folder in a folder where you cloned this project
       * For example: The pj have saved in "A" folder so you need to create a "logs" folder in "A" folder
   * Then run bot

This bot is still in dev so sometimes it may occurs errors. Hopefully you can enjoy it :)
